Instead it uses the mean of the observed responses of dependent variable Y and always predicts this mean as the value of Y. Any regression model that we fit is compared to this baseline model to understand itâ€™s goodness of fit. Simply put, R-squared just explains how good is your model when compared to the baseline model. Thats about it.\n",
